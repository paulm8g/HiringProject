# Hiring Project
This is a small project that is meant to show some of my full stack skills and ability to learn new technologies quickly.  It is a fast and simple solution to the given [Hiring Project](https://github.com/StrivvenMedia/HiringProject).  Hope you find it interesting and elegant.



# Project Steps
1. First, you will first need to create the database.  I used a MySQL database.  The dump file to load the tables and data is in Part2-App/db_backup.sql. 
2. You will then need to change the $config['db'] variables at the top of index.php to point to your newly created database.  The index.php file is in Part2-App/src/public/.
3. Next you will need to run `php composer.phar install`  to get dependencies.
4. Once you have the page up and running, you will need to know a login.  The username and password for logging into the system is:
        Username: testUser
        Password: Pa$$word
